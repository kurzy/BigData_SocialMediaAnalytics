# BigData_SocialMediaAnalytics
This project collected, cleaned, and analysed social media data pertaining to the 'Amazon Alexa' and 'Amazon Echo' products.  

## Getting Started
The R script 'data_analysis.r' contains the code for the project.  
Data was collected from Twitter and Facebook, and each of these platforms requires you to obtain your own API keys/secrets. You can choose to fill in your details and run the collection process again, or use the exsiting data contained within the .RData file.

## Execution
Make sure you have R installed on your machine. Download R from  https://cran.r-project.org/.  
Make sure your R executable (e.g. C:\Program Files\R\R-xxxx\bin) is present in your PATH system environment variable.  
Run `R data_analysis.r`.  
The required R packages will be downloaded and installed for you when you run the script.
